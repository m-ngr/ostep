## Questions

1. Let’s examine a simple program, “loop.s”. First, just read and understand it. Then, run it with these arguments (`./x86.py -t 1 -p loop.s -i 100 -R dx`) This specifies a single thread, an interrupt every **100** instructions, and tracing of register `%dx`. What will %dx be during the run? Use the -c flag to check your answers; the answers, on the left, show the value of the register (or memory value) after the instruction on the right has run.

**Answer:**

| dx  | Thread 0         |
| --- | ---------------- |
| 0   |                  |
| -1  | 1000 sub $1,%dx  |
| -1  | 1001 test $0,%dx |
| -1  | 1002 jgte .top   |
| -1  | 1003 halt        |

---

2. Same code, different flags: (`./x86.py -p loop.s -t 2 -i 100 -a dx=3,dx=3 -R dx`) This specifies two threads, and initializes each `%dx` to **3**. What values will `%dx` see? Run with -c to check. Does the presence of multiple threads affect your calculations? Is there a race in this code?

**Answer:** no race condition since all manipulations happens on the register which is virualized, each thread has its own private register

| dx  | Thread 0                | Thread 1                |
| --- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 3   |                         |                         |
| 2   | 1000 sub $1,%dx         |                         |
| 2   | 1001 test $0,%dx        |                         |
| 2   | 1002 jgte .top          |                         |
| 1   | 1000 sub $1,%dx         |                         |
| 1   | 1001 test $0,%dx        |                         |

| 0   | 1002 jgte .top          |                         |
| -1  | 1000 sub $1,%dx         |                         |
| -1  | 1001 test $0,%dx        |                         |
| -1  | 1002 jgte .top          |                         |
| -1  | 1003 halt               |                         |

| 2   |                         | 1000 sub $1,%dx         |
| 2   |                         | 1001 test $0,%dx        |
| 2   |                         | 1002 jgte .top          |
| 1   |                         | 1000 sub $1,%dx         |

| 1   |                         | 1002 jgte .top          |
| 0   |                         | 1000 sub $1,%dx         |
| 0   |                         | 1001 test $0,%dx        |

| -1  |                         | 1003 halt               |

3. Run this: `./x86.py -p loop.s -t 2 -i 3 -r -R dx -a dx=3,dx=3` This makes the interrupt interval small/random; use different seeds (-s) to see different interleavings. Does the interrupt frequency change anything?

**Answer:** there is no need to run the experiment again. there is no race condition that can happen in this program since it manipulates data in registers which are virualized, each thread has its own private registers

---

4. Now, a different program, `looping-race-nolock.s`, which accesses a shared variable located at address **2000**; we’ll call this variable value. Run it with a single thread to confirm your understanding: `./x86.py -p looping-race-nolock.s -t 1 -M 2000` What is value (i.e., at memory address 2000) throughout the run? Use -c to check.

**Answer:**

| 2000 | Thread 0           |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| 0    |                    |
| 0    | 1000 mov 2000, %ax |
| 0    | 1001 add $1, %ax   |
| 1    | 1002 mov %ax, 2000 |
| 1    | 1003 sub $1, %bx   |
| 1    | 1004 test $0, %bx  |
| 1    | 1005 jgt .top      |
| 1    | 1006 halt          |

5. Run with multiple iterations/threads: `./x86.py -p looping-race-nolock.s -t 2 -a bx=3 -M 2000` Why does each thread loop three times? What is final value of value?

**Answer:** the final value is 6. the loop counter (bx) starts with 3 in each thread since it is register (virtualized)

| 2000 | ax  | bx  | Thread 0                | Thread 1                |
| ---- | --- | --- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 0    | 0   | 3   |                         |                         |
| 0    | 0   | 3   | 1000 mov 2000, %ax      |                         |
| 0    | 1   | 3   | 1001 add $1, %ax        |                         |

6. Run with random interrupt intervals: `./x86.py -p looping-race-nolock.s -t 2 -M 2000 -i 4 -r -s 0` with different seeds (-s 1, -s 2, etc.) Can you tell by looking at the thread interleaving what the final value of value will be? Does the timing of the interrupt matter? Where can it safely occur? Where not? In other words, where is the critical section exactly?

**Answer:** final value is 2.

| ---- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |

| 0    | 1001 add $1, %ax         | #                        |

7. Now examine fixed interrupt intervals: `./x86.py -p looping-race-nolock.s -a bx=1 -t 2 -M 2000 -i 1` What will the final value of the shared variable value be? What about when you change `-i 2`, `-i 3`, etc.? For which interrupt intervals does the program give the “correct” answer?

**Answer:** Correct values happens for interrupt intervals (i) >= 3; since the critical section is composed of 3 instructions

8. Run the same for more loops (e.g., set `-a bx=100`). What interrupt intervals (-i) lead to a correct outcome? Which intervals are surprising?

**Answer:** the correct outcome which is always (`value = 2 * bx`) happens when i is multiple of 3 (multiple of the critical section length), that is 3,6,9,12,....etc

---

9. One last program: wait-for-me.s. Run: `./x86.py -p wait-for-me.s -a ax=1,ax=0 -R ax -M 2000` This sets the `%ax` register to 1 for thread 0, and 0 for thread 1, and watches %ax and memory location 2000. How should the code behave? How is the value at location 2000 being used by the threads? What will its final value be?

**Answer:** final value = 1; it is being used as a boolean flag between the 2 threads

```c equivalent code
volatile int value = 0;
void* thread(void* arg) {
  int ax = (int) arg;

  if (ax == 1){
    value = 1;
  } else {
    while(value != 1)
    ; // spin (wait for value to be 1)
  }
}
```

10. Now switch the inputs: `./x86.py -p wait-for-me.s -a ax=0,ax=1 -R ax -M 2000` How do the threads behave? What is thread 0 doing? How would changing the interrupt interval (e.g., -i 1000, or perhaps to use random intervals) change the trace outcome? Is the program efficiently using the CPU?

**Answer:**

- Thread 0: spinning doing nothing waiting for value to change to 1
- Thread 1: run and change set the value to 1 so thread 0 can run.
- Changing the interval doesn't change the outcome
- No it doesn't since Thread 0 keeps spinning doing nothing wasting CPU cycles
