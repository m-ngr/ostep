# CPU MLFQ Scheduling Homework

- Homework [Instructions](./instructions.md)

## Questions

1. Run a few randomly-generated problems with just two jobs and two queues; compute the MLFQ execution trace for each. Make your life easier by limiting the length of each job and turning off I/Os.

**Answer:**

---

2. How would you run the scheduler to reproduce each of the exam- ples in the chapter?

**Answer:**

---

3. How would you configure the scheduler parameters to behave just like a round-robin scheduler?

**Answer:**

---

4. Craft a workload with two jobs and scheduler parameters so that one job takes advantage of the older Rules 4a and 4b (turned on with the -S flag) to game the scheduler and obtain 99% of the CPU over a particular time interval.

**Answer:**

---

5. Given a system with a quantum length of 10 ms in its highest queue, how often would you have to boost jobs back to the highest priority level (with the -B flag) in order to guarantee that a single long- running (and potentially-starving) job gets at least 5% of the CPU?

**Answer:**

---

6. One question that arises in scheduling is which end of a queue to add a job that just finished I/O; the -I flag changes this behavior for this scheduling simulator. Play around with some workloads and see if you can see the effect of this flag.

**Answer:**
